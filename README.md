## Welcome to NC-Hub
### What is this?
NC-Hub is a website that aims to bring all of the confusing tools here and there for the NuclearCraft mod and bring them together as one online tool. As well as create a hub to share designs from the community. And this is the source code for the website.

### Project Goal
NuclearCraft is a mod that basically requires external tools if you don't hate your life. But these tools are confusing, often outdated and not very well maintained. Also there is very little ways to share reactor designs publicly or format them to have compatibility between modpacks. We aim to bring 3 main features with this project :

- Designing : Bringing a final and easy way to design reactors online by taking inspiration of already existing, open source tools.

- Sharing : Share these reactors, save your favorite reactors, upvote reactors you think deserve to get more love or downvote reactors you think should be left in the grave. 

- Formatting : A common issue with existing tools is that all packs don't use the same blocks for every part of the reactor. For example, Nomifactory-CEu uses a Graphite block from GregTech CEu as a moderator, but existing tools will generate a Building Gadget string. The goal here is to be able to generate smart building gadget strings that will adapt the block used based on the pack (or using a custom block for it).

## Contribution
### Current state of project
NC-Hub is being maintained by me and me only for now, but this may change as the project advances. Currently there is no production of the website as it is not ready for that and only at its infancy stage.

### Can I use your code?
Yes, copy paste everything you want to copy paste, deploy your own version of the website, monetize it. Do whatever you want, but make sure to credit me.
